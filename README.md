Errand Folks
	Errand Folks is an online web application that helps those who have money and no time or ability to run errands.Workers can do errands for an affordable price. Errand Folks can help those who have time and need money. One might say you can use the gigs section of craigslist and make some money or have some people help you with errands such as filing tax forms and fixing computers. Errand Folks will be more specific and shows the errands that need to get done in the workers neighbourhood. It will also provide reviews on workers to allow clients to choose the best possible people for the job. For example, imagine a student that needs to make money but does not have enough time to get a job. He can use our app to help someone with a task that can be done in a day in return for some cash. On the other hand, imagine if a woman asks her son to fix his computer; however, unfortunately the son has a full-time job and is a part-time student but she is willing to pay someone money to have them fix the problem.
