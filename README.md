Meal Picker

Project Abstract
Meal Picker is an online web application that allows users to choose what they want to eat in a simple fashion. Users can sign up/login and specify their needs and location which will result in the app providing restaurant options around them. This application will allow users to be more specific by enabling options such as breakfast or lunch, or even the type of cuisine desired. 

Customer Analysis
The target customers are mainly young adults who are working and have limited breaks for food, such as office workers. Therefore, they have a short amount of time to decide what to eat. This app will allow clients to quickly identify desired and nearby food choices without having the need to spend time looking. 

Competitive Analysis
Some competitors in the market are Yelp and Zomato. The main ways in which our project is going to be different are that the user can narrow down their specifications even further. Also, the user interface will be less complex and easy to maneuver.

UI Requirements
Login Page
The first page users would see is the login page. Here, previous users will login or first time users can sign up.
Input Page
After logging in, users will be redirected to an input page. This is where users are able to specify preferences.
There will be a status bar where users can input his/her preferences
Our API will calculate the best result depending on the inputs given
There may be preset checkboxes for quick selections
Result Page
Afterwards, the application presents the results to the user.
Results will be neatly shown in the form of a list
Shown results will be limited depending on the total search results of the API (ex: 5 options max at a time)


Errand Folks

Errand Folks can help those who have time and need money. One might say you can use the gigs section of craigslist and make some money or have some people help you with errands such as filing tax forms and fixing computers. Errand Folks will be more specific and shows the errands that need to get done in the workers neighbourhood. It will also provide reviews on workers to allow clients to choose the best possible people for the job. For example, imagine a student that needs to make money but does not have enough time to get a job. He can use our app to help someone with a task that can be done in a day in return for some cash. On the other hand, imagine if a woman asks her son to fix his computer; however, unfortunately the son has a full-time job and is a part-time student but she is willing to pay someone money to have them fix the problem.
