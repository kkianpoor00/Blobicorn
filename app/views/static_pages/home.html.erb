    <p class="vis-p">
       Our lives floods us everyday with more things to do, and less time to do them. From mowing the lawn, to buying groceries, there is simply no easy way to comfortably fit in all these errands around the tedious 9 to 5 workday. We here at the Errand Folks development team believe that society needs a solution to this problem that affects many of us everyday. Our solution is a web application that connects people who do not have enough time or ability to run errands, with those who do. This application provides a way for clients to match with each other quickly, and effectively. Whether you're a college student who needs money to afford groceries, or a store manager with not enough time to buy groceries, Errand Folks will connect you with someone who can help.

             I have this brilliant idea for a website, it's called Favor Friends. Users will be able to do favors for other users in exchange for money. People can ask for favors too. It'll be great.
